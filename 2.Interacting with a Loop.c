/*
LOOPS: LESSON
Interacting with a Loop
Before we dive deep into the syntax of a loop, let’s do a demo!

We have a program that asks and checks for a pin. It uses a while loop, which will be the first type of loop we’ll learn about, to ask the user to type and enter a pin over and over again until the correct one is entered.

As a reminder, here’s how to compile and execute your code:

gcc enter_pin.c
./a.out
Note: You don’t need to understand the code yet, just how to interact with it!

Instructions
1.
Compile and execute in the terminal using

gcc enter_pin.c
./a.out
Note: The check will be red until you input the last PIN! This includes when you compile.

When the program asks you to Enter your PIN:, try the following:

Type 1111 and press enter.

Type 2021 and press enter.

Type 1234 and press enter.
