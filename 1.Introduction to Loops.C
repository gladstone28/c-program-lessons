LOOPS: LESSON
Introduction to Loops
A loop is a way to repeat code or a set of instructions until a specified condition is reached.

For example, have you ever been looking for somebody in a grocery store? You check each aisle until you find them. You naturally perform certain tasks with a repetition, or iteration, until a condition is met. In this case, when you finally catch that glimpse of a familiar person!

That generic term “iterate” means “to repeat.” You’ll find that, just like in real life, you’ll use loops in your code all the time! And just like this infinite GIF of blocks turning, a task may repeat seemingly infinitely, but you always have a way to control when it stops.

When we see that a process has to be repeated multiple times in a row, we write a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.

In this lesson, we will learn about three types of loops: while loops, do-while loops, and for loops!
